For running unit tests, put the sample glTF files from this repository into this folder:

https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models

Note: To keep build size/time small, feel free to remove all non GLB 2.0 files.

The test settings in config.json are retrieved from the model-viewer project:
